# Seattle-Redfin-Housing-Analysis

This dataset consists of 34 attributes and 381 data. With this data we visualized different segments of illustrations like: Listings Location, Neighborhood, Average Listing Period, and Sale Price Difference. After doing each of these visualizations, I then created one dashboard and one-story board, covering all these analyses.

This dataset consists of the following attributes: SALE TYPE, HOME TYPE, ADDRESS, CITY, STATE, ZIP, LIST PRICE, BEDS, BATHS, LOCATION, SQFT, LOT SIZE, YEAR BUILT, PARKING SPOTS, PARKING TYPE, DAYS ON MARKET, STATUS, NEXT OPEN HOUSE DATE, NEXT OPEN HOUSE START TIME, NEXT OPEN HOUSE END TIME, RECENT REDUCTION DATE, ORIGINAL LIST PRICE, LAST SALE DATE, LAST SALE PRICE, URL (SEE http://www.redfin.com/buy-a-home/comparative-market-analysis FOR INFO ON PRICING), SOURCE, LISTING ID, ORIGINAL SOURCE, FAVORITE, INTERESTED, LATITUDE, LONGITUDE, IS SHORT SALE, and Neighborhood.

The attached Pdf file has the visualizations that are done with tableau.
